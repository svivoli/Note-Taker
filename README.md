## Developer Experience

After having completed the command line applications, the PDF Generator and the Team Builder, this project felt like less of a challenge. I am feeling comfortable with node and am enjoying exploring the versatility of api routes. I took some extra time to personalize the premade html files and had some fun playing with the fonts and design of the website.
